# SentinelStacks Docker-Inspired Commands Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive set of Docker-inspired commands for the SentinelStacks system, providing an intuitive interface for managing AI agents and their interactions. The implementation follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns and modularity.

## Key Features

1. **Docker-Like Interface**: Commands follow the familiar Docker CLI pattern for ease of adoption
2. **Comprehensive Command Set**: Support for networks, volumes, multi-agent systems, and system management
3. **File System Storage**: Persistent storage of agent states, networks, and volumes
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with command, service, and repository layers
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new commands or modify existing ones

## Commands Implemented

### Network Management
- `sentinel network create`: Create communication networks for agents
- `sentinel network ls`: List available networks
- `sentinel network connect`: Connect agents to networks
- `sentinel network disconnect`: Disconnect agents from networks
- `sentinel network inspect`: Show detailed network information
- `sentinel network rm`: Remove networks

### Volume Management
- `sentinel volume create`: Create persistent memory volumes
- `sentinel volume ls`: List available volumes
- `sentinel volume mount`: Mount volumes to agents
- `sentinel volume unmount`: Unmount volumes from agents
- `sentinel volume inspect`: Show detailed volume information
- `sentinel volume rm`: Remove volumes

### Multi-Agent Systems (Compose)
- `sentinel compose up`: Create and start multi-agent systems
- `sentinel compose ls`: List running systems
- `sentinel compose pause`: Pause multi-agent systems
- `sentinel compose resume`: Resume paused systems
- `sentinel compose logs`: View system logs
- `sentinel compose down`: Stop and remove systems

### System Management
- `sentinel system info`: Display system information
- `sentinel system df`: Show disk usage
- `sentinel system prune`: Remove unused data
- `sentinel system events`: View system events

### Other Commands
- `sentinel exec`: Execute one-time commands
- `sentinel shell`: Interact with agents through a shell
- `sentinel pull`: Pull agent images from a registry
- `sentinel push`: Push agent images to a registry
- `sentinel search`: Search for agent images
- `sentinel login/logout`: Authenticate with registries

## Architecture

### Command Layer (CLI)
- Uses Cobra for command definitions
- Handles user input and output formatting
- Delegates business logic to the service layer

### Service Layer
- Implements business logic for each domain
- Coordinates operations across repositories
- Validates inputs and enforces rules

### Repository Layer
- Provides data access abstraction
- Implements persistence using file system storage
- Follows the repository pattern for easy swapping of backends

### Model Layer
- Defines core domain entities
- Represents fundamental concepts like networks, volumes, and systems

## Implementation Details

### Data Storage
- Networks are stored as JSON files in `~/.sentinel/data/networks/`
- Volumes are stored as JSON files in `~/.sentinel/data/volumes/`
- Multi-agent systems are stored as JSON files in `~/.sentinel/data/systems/`

### Configuration
- Uses Viper for configuration management
- Stores configuration in `~/.sentinel/config.yaml`

### Error Handling
- Consistent error messages with detailed information
- Graceful handling of expected error conditions

## Testing

A comprehensive test script is provided to verify the functionality of all commands:

```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x test-all-docker-commands.sh

# Run the tests
./test-all-docker-commands.sh
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Storage**: Replace file system storage with a proper database
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Add user management and permissions
3. **Remote Management**: Support for managing remote SentinelStacks instances
4. **Advanced Networking**: Implement more sophisticated agent communication patterns
5. **Resource Limits**: Add more granular resource limits for agents
6. **Metrics & Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring capabilities for agent performance

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `docs` directory:
- `docs/docker-commands.md`: Command reference with examples
- Examples in the `examples` directory

## Getting Started

To build and run SentinelStacks:

```bash
# Build the binary
go build -o sentinel main.go

# Run a command
./sentinel system info
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust foundation for managing AI agents using familiar Docker-like commands. The modular, clean architecture ensures that the system can be easily extended and maintained as requirements evolve.
