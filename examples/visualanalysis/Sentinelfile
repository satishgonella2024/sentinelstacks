The beach has light-colored sand, and there are some trees visible on the right side of the image."

    response: "Yes, I can see text in this image. There's a sign that reads 'OCEAN VIEW TRAIL' in the foreground. Below that, there appears to be some smaller text that says 'KEEP ON DESIGNATED PATHS' and what looks like distance information, possibly '2.5 MILES'."
