# SentinelStacks Docker-Inspired Commands Implementation

This implementation adds Docker-inspired commands to the SentinelStacks system for managing AI agents, networks, volumes, and multi-agent systems.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation follows a robust design with several key components:

### 1. Data Models

- `Network`: Represents connections between agents
- `Volume`: Represents persistent memory for agents
- `MultiAgentSystem`: Represents a collection of agents working together

### 2. Repository Layer

The repository layer provides data persistence through filesystem-based implementations:

- `FSNetworkRepository`: Stores and retrieves network data
- `FSVolumeRepository`: Manages volume data
- `FSMultiAgentSystemRepository`: Handles multi-agent system configuration

### 3. Service Layer

Services encapsulate business logic:

- `NetworkService`: Manages agent networks
- `VolumeService`: Handles agent memory volumes
- `ComposeService`: Orchestrates multi-agent systems

### 4. Command Layer

Commands provide a Docker-like CLI interface:

- `network` commands: Create and manage agent communication networks
- `volume` commands: Manage persistent memory for agents
- `compose` commands: Deploy and manage multi-agent systems
- Support commands like `exec`, `shell`, etc.

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or later
- SentinelStacks prerequisites

### Building

Build the project with:

```bash
go build -o sentinel main.go
```

### Testing Network Commands

```bash
# Create a network
./sentinel network create test-network

# List networks
./sentinel network ls

# Connect an agent to a network
./sentinel network connect test-network agent1

# Inspect a network
./sentinel network inspect test-network

# Disconnect an agent from a network
./sentinel network disconnect test-network agent1

# Remove a network
./sentinel network rm test-network
```

### Testing Volume Commands

```bash
# Create a volume
./sentinel volume create test-volume --size 2GB --encrypted

# List volumes
./sentinel volume ls

# Mount a volume to an agent
./sentinel volume mount test-volume agent1 --path /memory

# Inspect a volume
./sentinel volume inspect test-volume

# Unmount a volume from an agent
./sentinel volume unmount test-volume agent1

# Remove a volume
./sentinel volume rm test-volume
```

### Testing Compose Commands

```bash
# Create and start a multi-agent system
./sentinel compose up -f compose-example.yaml

# List running systems
./sentinel compose ls

# Pause a system
./sentinel compose pause <system-id>

# Resume a system
./sentinel compose resume <system-id>

# Stop and remove a system
./sentinel compose down <system-id>
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Persistent Storage**: Implement actual storage backends for volumes
2. **Agent Communication**: Implement real agent-to-agent communication protocols
3. **Security & Access Controls**: Add RBAC and security controls
4. **Distributed Operation**: Support for distributed agent deployments
5. **Monitoring & Metrics**: Add enhanced monitoring capabilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that the data directory is writable
2. Ensure the home directory is properly configured
3. Look for error messages in the output
4. Use the system log for more detailed diagnostics
