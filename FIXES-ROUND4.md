# Additional Fixes - Round 4

This document describes the final round of fixes needed for the SentinelStacks repository:

## 1. Fixed Image Structure
- Removed unused "time" import from image.go
- Updated Image struct to have Dependencies field instead of Parameters to match agent.Image
- Fixed conversion functions between registry.Image and agent.Image

## 2. Cleaned Up Duplicate Files
- Added a proper package declaration in the empty multimodal_fixed.go file
- Added a clean build script to remove problematic files before building

These changes should address all remaining build issues.
