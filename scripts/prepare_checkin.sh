# SentinelStacks Project - Current State

This document describes the current state of the SentinelStacks project as of the latest check-in.

## Core Components Implemented

1. **DAG Implementation**: The directed acyclic graph (DAG) implementation for the stack engine has been completed and tested.
2. **Memory Management Framework**: The framework for memory management has been designed and partially implemented.
3. **Stack Engine Design**: The overall architecture for the stack engine has been designed and the core components have been implemented.

## Working Components

- **DAG Implementation**: The topological sorting and cycle detection algorithms have been implemented and tested thoroughly.
- **Simple Testing Framework**: We've created a set of scripts to test the core functionality independently.

## Known Issues

1. **Import Cycles**: There are circular dependencies between some packages that need to be resolved.
2. **Module Path**: The module path in go.mod needs to be consistent with the repository path.
3. **Testing Limitations**: Full integration testing isn't possible until import cycles are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. **Address Import Cycles**: Extract common interfaces into separate packages to break circular dependencies.
2. **Stabilize Module Structure**: Ensure consistent module paths and fix all imports.
3. **Complete Memory Implementation**: Finish implementing the local, SQLite, and Chroma backends.
4. **Begin Registry Implementation**: Start work on the registry system for sharing agents.

## Test Results

- **Simple DAG Test**: ✅ Passed
- **Minimal DAG Test**: ✅ Passed
- **Full Integration Test**: ❌ Blocked by import cycles

Suggested commit message:
=========================
feat: Implement DAG-based stack engine core

- Add DAG implementation with topological sorting and cycle detection
- Design memory management framework
- Add test scripts to verify core functionality
- Document current state and next steps

The core DAG functionality works as expected, but there are some import cycle issues
that prevent building the full system. These will be addressed in subsequent commits.
