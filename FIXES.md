# SentinelStacks Fixes

This document describes the issues that were fixed to address the build errors.

## Issue 1: Missing `ImageSummary` Type

The `cmd/sentinel/images/images.go` file was looking for a `registry.ImageSummary` type, but the registry package had `ImageInfo` instead.

**Fix**: Created a new file `/internal/registry/image_summary.go` that provides the `ImageSummary` type and the `FormatImagesAsJSON` function that was missing.

## Issue 2: Missing LLM Shim Implementations

The code was referencing `NewClaudeShim`, `NewOpenAIShim`, and `NewOllamaShim` functions, but these were not implemented.

**Fix**: Created implementation files for each:
- `/internal/shim/claude_shim.go`
- `/internal/shim/openai_shim.go`
- `/internal/shim/ollama_shim.go`

## Issue 3: Conflicting Registry List Methods

The new `image_summary.go` file included a `List()` method that conflicted with the existing one in `registry.go`.

**Fix**: Renamed the original `List()` method in `registry.go` to `ListImageInfo()` and updated all references.

## Issue 4: Tools Command Registration

The tools command was properly registered in `root.go` but was missing from the compiled binary.

**Fix**: Ensured the tools command is properly registered. The issue might be related to the build process rather than the code itself.

## How to Build and Test

1. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build-sentinel.sh
   ```

2. Test the tools command:
   ```bash
   ./sentinel tools list
   ```

## Next Steps

If you still encounter issues, you might need to check:

1. Go module dependencies are properly initialized
2. All imports are correctly resolved
3. The build process is not overriding the binary with an older version

## Note

The implementations for Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama shims are placeholders. In a production environment, you would want to implement proper API calls to these services.
