## Metrics for Success

- **Phase 1**: Complete end-to-end workflow for multi-agent stacks using CLI
- **Phase 2**: Successfully share and reuse agents across multiple developers
- **Phase 3**: Positive user feedback on UI and documentation

## Potential Risks

1. **Integration Complexity**: Multi-agent DAG execution may be more complex than anticipated
2. **Registry Security**: Ensuring proper security for the registry system
3. **Performance**: Stack execution with many agents may have performance challenges
4. **API Stability**: Ensuring API changes don't break existing functionality

## Mitigation Strategies

1. Start with simple DAG patterns and gradually add complexity
2. Implement security review checkpoints throughout Phase 2
3. Add performance benchmarks and monitoring early
4. Maintain API versioning and backward compatibility where possible
