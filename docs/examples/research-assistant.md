# Research Assistant Example

This example demonstrates how to build an advanced research assistant agent using SentinelStacks with Claude 3 Opus.

## Overview

The Research Assistant is a sophisticated agent designed to assist with in-depth research tasks. It can search for information, analyze documents, generate citations, take notes, and create structured research reports.

## Building the Agent

Build the research assistant agent using the following command:

```bash
./bin/sentinel build -t demo/research-assistant:v1 -f examples/research-assistant/Sentinelfile \
  --llm anthropic --llm-model claude-3-opus
```

## Running the Agent

Run the research assistant with:

```bash
./bin/sentinel run demo/research-assistant:v1
```

This will start an interactive session where you can ask the agent to research topics for you.

## Advanced Features

### Research Methodology

The agent follows a structured research methodology:

1. **Initial Query Refinement**: Clarifies the research question
2. **Source Gathering**: Collects relevant sources
3. **Information Extraction**: Extracts key information from sources
4. **Analysis and Synthesis**: Analyzes and combines information
5. **Conclusion Formulation**: Draws conclusions from the analysis
6. **Citation and Bibliography**: Properly cites all sources

### Tool Integration

The agent has access to several tools:

- **Web Search**: Searches the internet for up-to-date information
- **Document Reader**: Reads and analyzes various document formats
- **Citation Generator**: Creates properly formatted citations
- **Note Taking**: Saves important information during research
- **Report Generator**: Creates structured research reports

### Security Controls

The agent has security features to ensure responsible information handling:

- Strict private data policy
- Required source validation
- Required citations
- Disclosure of uncertainty

## Example Use Cases

- Academic research on specific topics
- Literature reviews
- Market research
- Technology trend analysis
- Competitive intelligence gathering
- Fact-checking and verification

## Customization

You can customize this agent by modifying the Sentinelfile:

- Adjust model parameters for different research styles
- Configure different citation formats
- Change the research methodology
- Add or remove specific tools
- Modify security controls
