## Agent Design Patterns

### Specialized Agents

Specialized agents focus on a specific domain or task:

- **Domain Expert Agents**: Deep knowledge in fields like finance, medicine, or law
- **Task-Specific Agents**: Optimized for tasks like summarization, code generation, or data analysis
- **Tool-Using Agents**: Primarily focused on effectively using external tools

### Multi-Agent Systems

Coordination of multiple agents working together:

- **Manager-Worker Pattern**: A manager agent coordinates specialized worker agents
- **Peer Collaboration**: Agents of similar capabilities collaborating on complex tasks
- **Competitive Agents**: Multiple agents proposing solutions with voting mechanisms

### Stateful Agents

Agents that maintain persistent state across sessions:

- **Long-Term Memory**: Storing and recalling user preferences and past interactions
- **Progressive Learning**: Building knowledge over multiple sessions
- **Context Awareness**: Adapting to changing operational conditions

## Advanced Capabilities

### Tool Integration

```yaml
tools:
  - web_search:
      purpose: For retrieving information from the internet
      parameters:
        max_results: 5
        search_depth: 2
        filter_domain: all
  - code_executor:
      purpose: For running and testing code
      parameters:
        languages: [python, javascript, go]
        timeout: 5s
        sandbox: true
  - document_processor:
      purpose: For handling structured documents
      parameters:
        formats: [pdf, docx, txt, json]
        max_size: 10MB
```

### External Data Sources

```yaml
data_sources:
  - market_data:
      update_frequency: realtime
      source: financial_api
      access: read_only
      credentials: env.MARKET_API_KEY
  - user_database:
      update_frequency: on_demand
      source: internal_database
      access: read_write
      authentication: oauth2
```

### Compliance Controls

```yaml
compliance:
  regulatory_frameworks:
    - gdpr
    - hipaa
    - financial_regulations
  privacy_controls:
    - data_minimization
    - user_consent_required
    - data_retention_policy
  security_measures:
    - encryption_at_rest
    - secure_communications
    - access_controls
```

## Enhanced Cognitive Capabilities

### Reasoning Frameworks

```yaml
cognition:
  reasoning_methods:
    - chain_of_thought
    - tree_of_thought
    - backtracking
  decision_approach:
    - cost_benefit_analysis
    - risk_assessment
    - ethical_consideration
```

### Adaptability

```yaml
adaptability:
  learning_mechanisms:
    - feedback_incorporation
    - observation_based
    - reinforcement
  adaptation_triggers:
    - performance_metrics
    - user_feedback
    - environmental_changes
```

## Multi-Agent Communication

### Message Protocols

```yaml
communication:
  protocols:
    - json_messages
    - structured_queries
    - natural_language
  channels:
    - agent_bus:
        access: read_write
        format: json
    - human_interface:
        access: read_write
        format: natural_language
```

### Team Structures

```yaml
team:
  role: coordinator
  reports_to: human_supervisor
  manages:
    - researcher
    - writer
    - reviewer
  communication_patterns:
    - status_updates: hourly
    - escalation_path: [team_lead, supervisor]
```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

```yaml
resources:
  memory_management:
    max_context_size: 32000
    prioritization: recency_weighted
  compute_allocation:
    token_budget: 100000
    batch_processing: true
```

### Caching Strategies

```yaml
caching:
  response_cache:
    enabled: true
    ttl: 24h
    invalidation_triggers: [new_data, user_request]
  knowledge_cache:
    enabled: true
    persistent: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple, Add Complexity**: Begin with a basic agent and incrementally add advanced features
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate each capability before combining multiple advanced features
3. **Consider Ethical Implications**: Evaluate potential impacts and build in appropriate safeguards
4. **Document Extensively**: Provide clear documentation for complex agent configurations
5. **Implement Monitoring**: Add logging and observability for complex agent behaviors
6. **Use Appropriate Guardrails**: Always include safety mechanisms appropriate to the agent's capabilities

## Real-World Applications

- **Enterprise Customer Support**: Multi-agent system with triage, specialists, and escalation
- **Research Collaboration**: Team of agents working on complex research questions
- **Content Production**: Coordinated content creation, editing, and publishing pipeline
- **Financial Services**: Compliance-aware advisory agents with market data integration
- **Healthcare Assistance**: Privacy-conscious agents for healthcare information management

## Conclusion

Advanced agent design with SentinelStacks allows for creating sophisticated AI systems that can handle complex tasks, maintain appropriate safeguards, and work together effectively. By leveraging the full capabilities of the Sentinelfile format, you can create agents that are specialized, collaborative, and responsible.
