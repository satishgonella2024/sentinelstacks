# SentinelStacks System Design

This document provides a detailed overview of the SentinelStacks system architecture, explaining design decisions, component interactions, and technical considerations.

## System Architecture Overview

SentinelStacks is built as a distributed system with clearly defined boundaries between components. The architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific, well-defined responsibility
2. **Modularity**: Components can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be easily extended with new capabilities
4. **Compatibility**: Follows industry standards where possible for interoperability

### Architecture Layers

The system consists of several key layers:

1. **User Interface Layer**
   - CLI Tool
   - Desktop Application
   - Web Interface
   - SDK Libraries

2. **Core Services Layer**
   - NLP Parser Service
   - Image Builder Service
   - Agent Runtime Service
   - Registry Service
   - Authentication Service

3. **Runtime Layer**
   - Sentinel Runtime
   - Sentinel Shim
   - State Manager
   - Tool Coordinator

4. **Integration Layer**
   - LLM Provider Connectors
   - External Tool Integrations
   - Third-Party Service Connectors

5. **Persistence Layer**
   - Object Storage
   - Metadata Database
   - State Database
   - Registry Database

## Component Details

### Sentinel CLI

The command-line interface serves as the primary interaction point for developers. Key design considerations:

- **Go Implementation**: Chosen for performance, cross-platform support, and single binary distribution
- **Cobra Framework**: Provides a consistent command structure and help documentation
- **Local Configuration**: Uses a configuration file in `~/.sentinel/config.json` for settings
- **Offline Capability**: Core functions work without internet connectivity
- **Extensible**: Plugin system allows adding custom commands

### Sentinel Desktop

The desktop application provides a graphical interface for agent management:

- **Electron Framework**: Cross-platform desktop application
- **React Frontend**: Component-based UI architecture
- **Local Agent Management**: Manages local agents directly
- **Visual Builder**: Graphical agent building capabilities
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of agent status and performance

### NLP Parser

The parser converts natural language Sentinelfiles into structured agent definitions:

- **Two-Stage Parsing**: Pre-processing followed by LLM-based understanding
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains context across complex descriptions
- **Validation Logic**: Ensures the extracted definition matches the intent
- **Default Inference**: Applies sensible defaults for unspecified parameters
- **Extensible Model**: Can work with different LLM backends

### Image Builder

Builds Sentinel Images from structured agent definitions:

- **Layer-Based Approach**: Similar to Docker's layer concept
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolves and includes dependencies
- **Version Tracking**: Built-in versioning for reproducibility
- **Cache Optimization**: Reuses layers from previous builds
- **Validation**: Ensures the image meets all requirements before completion

### Agent Runtime

Executes agent instances with appropriate capabilities:

- **Isolation**: Each agent runs in its own isolated environment
- **Resource Control**: Limits CPU, memory, and API call usage
- **Lifecycle Management**: Handles initialization, execution, and termination
- **State Persistence**: Maintains agent state across sessions
- **Monitoring**: Collects metrics and logs for monitoring

### Sentinel Shim

Abstracts differences between LLM providers:

- **Unified Interface**: Common interface across different LLMs
- **Provider-Specific Optimizations**: Optimizes prompts for each provider
- **Context Management**: Handles context window limitations
- **Caching**: Implements caching for efficiency
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides graceful degradation when primary providers fail

### Registry Service

Stores and distributes agent definitions:

- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Uses content hashes for immutability
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for repositories
- **Versioning**: Supports semantic versioning
- **Metadata**: Rich metadata for discoverability
- **Search Capabilities**: Full-text search and filtering

### State Manager

Handles agent state persistence and synchronization:

- **Schema Validation**: Ensures state conforms to the defined schema
- **Persistence Options**: Multiple backend options (local, Redis, database)
- **Synchronization**: Handles state synchronization for distributed agents
- **Migration Support**: Manages state schema migrations
- **Snapshot & Restore**: Provides point-in-time state snapshots

## Data Flow

### Agent Creation Flow

1. User writes a natural language Sentinelfile
2. Parser converts it to a structured agent definition
3. Builder creates a Sentinel Image from the definition
4. Image is stored locally or pushed to a registry

### Agent Execution Flow

1. Runtime loads an image from local storage or registry
2. Runtime initializes the agent environment
3. Shim establishes connection to the appropriate LLM provider
4. Agent begins execution with the provided state and tools
5. State Manager persists state changes
6. Tool Coordinator handles tool access and permissions

### Registry Interaction Flow

1. User authenticates with the registry
2. Images are pushed to or pulled from the registry
3. Registry validates and stores metadata
4. Search and discovery services index the metadata
5. Access control enforces permissions

## Technical Specifications

### Agent Definition Format

The structured agent definition is stored in JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "research-assistant",
  "description": "An agent that helps with academic research",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "baseModel": "claude-3.7-sonnet",
  "capabilities": [
    "web_search",
    "document_analysis",
    "summarization",
    "citation_management"
  ],
  "stateSchema": {
    "research_topic": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Current research topic"
    },
    "reviewed_papers": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "title": { "type": "string" },
          "authors": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },

      "name": "pdf_parser",
      "config": {
        "extract_citations": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Image Format

Sentinel Images use a layered format similar to OCI container images:

- **Manifest Layer**: Contains metadata and references to other layers
- **Definition Layer**: The structured agent definition
- **State Schema Layer**: Schema for the agent's state
- **Tool Configuration Layer**: Configuration for tools
- **Dependency Layer**: References to other images or resources

### State Storage

Agent state is stored in a structured format:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "agent_id": "abc123",
  "created_at": "2025-03-30T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-03-31T09:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "research_topic": "Climate change mitigation strategies",
    "reviewed_papers": [
      {
        "title": "Recent Advances in Carbon Capture",
        "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Jones, M."],
        "url": "https://example.com/paper1",
        "notes": "Discusses direct air capture technologies"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Model

### Authentication & Authorization

- **User Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with support for multiple identity providers
- **Client Authentication**: API keys or client certificates
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **Token Management**: Short-lived tokens with refresh capability

### Agent Security

- **Execution Isolation**: Agents run in isolated environments
- **Tool Permissions**: Capability-based security model for tool access
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of LLM APIs

## Scalability Approach

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Components**: Core services are stateless for horizontal scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across service instances
- **Data Partitioning**: Shards data by user, organization, or other dimensions
- **Caching**: Multi-level caching for improved performance

### Vertical Scaling

- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient resource usage within components
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background processing for intensive tasks
- **Batching**: Combines operations where possible for efficiency
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses connections to databases and external services

### Distributed Architecture

- **Service Discovery**: Automatic discovery of service instances
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Eventual Consistency**: For registry and non-critical operations
- **Strong Consistency**: For agent state and critical operations
