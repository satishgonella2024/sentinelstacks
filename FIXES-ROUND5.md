# Additional Fixes - Round 5

This document describes the final fix needed for the SentinelStacks repository:

## Fixed Type Mismatch in build.go

- Added conversion from agent.Image to registry.Image when saving to the registry
- Using `registry.ConvertFromAgentImage(image)` to convert the type before calling reg.Save

This should be the last change needed to make the project build successfully.
