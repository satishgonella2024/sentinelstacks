# Additional Fixes - Round 3

This document describes more fixes we made to resolve compilation errors:

## 1. Fixed Duplicate Files
- Removed the duplicate `multimodal_fixed.go` file that was causing compilation errors

## 2. Fixed MultimodalAgent Issues
- Added an `AddSystemPrompt` method to match the expected method name in the chat command
- Added a `metadata` field to the MultimodalAgent struct and initialized it in NewMultimodalAgent

## 3. Fixed Chat Command Multimodal Input Handling
- Updated the way multimodal input is constructed in the chat command using `multimodal.NewInput()` instead of direct array manipulation

## 4. Fixed Run Command Issues
- Removed unused `shim` import
- Created proper `Image` and `ImageDefinition` types in registry package
- Updated registry methods to use the new types and conversion methods

## 5. Fixed Registry Type Issues
- Added `ConvertFromAgentImage` and `ConvertToAgentImage` methods to convert between registry and agent image types
- Updated `Get`, `Save`, and `Delete` methods to use the new `Image` type

These fixes should resolve the compilation errors and allow the project to build successfully.
