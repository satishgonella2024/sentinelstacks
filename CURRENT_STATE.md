# SentinelStacks Project - Current State

This document describes the current state of the SentinelStacks project as of the latest check-in.

## Core Components Implemented

1. **DAG Implementation**: The directed acyclic graph (DAG) implementation for the stack engine has been completed and tested.
2. **Memory Management Framework**: The memory management framework has been implemented with multiple backends (Local, SQLite, and Chroma).
3. **Stack Engine Design**: The overall architecture for the stack engine has been implemented and the core components are working.
4. **Registry System**: Basic registry operations (push/pull) are implemented, and authentication has been added.

## Working Components

- **DAG Implementation**: The topological sorting and cycle detection algorithms have been implemented and tested thoroughly.
- **Memory System**: Local, SQLite, and Chroma vector store implementations are functional.
- **Testing Framework**: We've created a set of scripts to test the core functionality independently.
- **Registry Authentication**: File-based token provider for registry authentication is implemented.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Import Cycles Resolved**: We've resolved import cycles by:
   - Extracting common interfaces into the `pkg/types` package
   - Updating implementation packages to use these common types
   - Refactoring code to follow dependency inversion principle

2. **Memory System Enhanced**:
   - Implemented SQLiteMemoryStore for persistent storage
   - Implemented LocalMemoryStore with updated interfaces
   - Implemented ChromaVectorStore for vector embeddings

3. **Registry System Improved**:
   - Implemented authentication with file-based token provider
   - Updated package management to use common types

## Known Issues

1. **Testing Limitations**: Full integration testing isn't fully implemented yet.
2. **Registry System**: Search functionality and tag management need enhancement.
3. **Security Features**: Agent signatures and verification not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Registry System**: Finish implementing tag management and search functionality.
2. **Implement Security Features**: Add agent signature and verification.
3. **Improve Test Coverage**: Add more unit and integration tests.
4. **Begin UI Development**: Start work on the DAG visualizer and agent logs view.
