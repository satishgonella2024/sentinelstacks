# SentinelStacks Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Stack Engine Core

We have implemented a complete Stack Engine that:
- Creates and executes Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of agents
- Provides topological sorting for execution order
- Detects cycles in dependencies
- Tracks execution state of each agent
- Propagates context between connected agents

### 2. Agent State Management

We've created a robust state management system:
- In-memory state management with persistence capability
- JSON serialization for state transfer
- Context propagation between agents
- Input/output mapping with flexible keys

### 3. CLI Commands

We've implemented a comprehensive set of CLI commands:
- `sentinel stack run` - Run multi-agent stacks
- `sentinel stack init` - Initialize new stacks with templates or NL
- `sentinel stack list` - List available stacks
- `sentinel stack inspect` - Examine stack structure and execution plan

### 4. Agent Runtime Integration

We've built a real agent runtime that:
- Executes actual agents via the Sentinel command
- Handles agent inputs and outputs via JSON
- Checks for agent existence and pulls/builds as needed
- Manages temporary working directories

### 5. Natural Language Parser

We've implemented a parser that:
- Converts natural language descriptions to stack specifications
- Extracts agent relationships from text
- Identifies agent capabilities from descriptions
- Generates appropriate agent types

### 6. Example Stacks

We've created example stacks that demonstrate:
- Simple analysis pipelines
- Complex data processing systems
- Research and assistance workflows
- Conversational enhancement patterns
