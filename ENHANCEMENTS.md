# Sentinel Stacks Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements for the Sentinel Stacks platform.

## Upcoming Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Memory Implementations

- **Redis Integration**: Add Redis-backed memory store for distributed deployments
- **Vector Database Integrations**: 
  - Support for Pinecone
  - Support for Weaviate
  - Support for Milvus
- **Memory Sharding**: Implement sharding for large-scale deployments
- **Memory Caching**: Add multi-level caching for improved performance

### 2. Web UI Development

- **React-based Dashboard**: Create a comprehensive UI for stack management
- **Stack Visualization Tool**: Interactive graph visualization for stack dependencies
- **Execution Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of stack execution
- **Stack Designer**: Visual drag-and-drop interface for creating stacks

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure API access with JSON Web Tokens
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different users
- **API Key Management**: Generate and manage API keys for programmatic access
- **Single Sign-On**: Integration with OAuth providers

### 4. Observability Features

- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Distributed tracing across stack executions
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Expose metrics endpoints for monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Enhanced logging with levels and formatters
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Monitor system health and dependencies

### 5. Advanced Stack Execution

- **Conditional Execution Paths**: Add if/else logic to stack definitions
- **Loop Constructs**: Support for iteration in stack definitions
- **Checkpointing**: Resume stack execution from saved checkpoints
- **Execution Quotas**: Limit resource usage per stack or user
